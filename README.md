# Movie Traile Website - FSND Project 1

This is the source code for the Movie Trailer website project, the first project of Full Stack Nanodegree Programme in Udacity. This project is made by Widya A. Puspitaloka. 

The website will show a list of some movies along with a few line of synopsis and the trailer. 

### Installation
Python is needed to run and build the website.
This website was developed in Python 2.7.13.

### Usage
* Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.
* Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
* To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py - this module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
* Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.
